# Close & Forget Tab (Stealth Edition)

A lightweight Chrome/Firefox extension that lets you **close a tab and instantly forget it** — clearing 1 minute of history — as if it was never opened.

We named it **Utility Kit** by default to make the extension look **stealthy and generic**.

---

## Features

- **Close & Forget**: One click wipes a tab’s browsing data after closing.
- **Stealth Mode**: Shows up as **Utility Kit** in the extension list.
- **Custom Labeling**: Inside the popup, users can rename the extension title and buttons to fit their cover story.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Assign a hotkey to instantly close & forget a tab.
